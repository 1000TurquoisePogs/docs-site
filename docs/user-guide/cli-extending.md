# Extending Zowe CLI

You can install plug-ins to extend the capabilities of Zowe CLI. Plug-ins CLI to third-party applications are also available, such as Visual Studio Code Extension for Zowe (powered by Zowe CLI). Plug-ins add functionality to the product in the form of new command groups, actions, objects, and options. 

**Important!** Plug-ins can gain control of your CLI application legitimately during the execution of every command. Install third-party plug-ins at your own risk. We make no warranties regarding the use of third-party plug-ins.
