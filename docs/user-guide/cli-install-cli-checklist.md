# Installation checklist

To plan your Zowe CLI installation, review the following checklist.

This checklist summarizes the required steps for a base installation (first-time installation) in the order you should perform them. The checklist includes a brief description of the steps, with links to the comprehensive information required for the installation. The checklist also identifies the roles that are typically required to complete the step, which enables the pre-installation planning team (systems programmer, security administrator, and so on) to focus on the tasks for which they are responsible.
