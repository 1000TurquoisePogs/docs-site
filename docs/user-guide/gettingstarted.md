# Obtaining installation files

The Zowe installation files are distributed as a PAX file that contains the runtimes and the scripts to install and launch the z/OS runtime and the runtime for the command line interface. For each release, there is a PAX file named `zowe-v.r.m.pax`, where

- `v` indicates the version
- `r` indicates the release number
- `m` indicates the modification number

The numbers are incremented each time a release is created so the higher the numbers, the later the release.  Use your web browser to download the PAX file by saving it to a folder on your desktop.

You can download the PAX file from the Zowe website. After you obtain the PAX file, transfer the PAX file to z/OS and prepare it to install the Zowe runtime.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Transfer the PAX file to z/OS.

    a. Open a terminal in Mac OS/Linux, or command prompt in Windows OS, and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Zowe PAX file.

    b. Connect to z/OS using SFTP. Issue the following command:

     ```
     sftp <userID@ip.of.zos.box>
     ```

     If SFTP is not available or if you prefer to use FTP, you can issue the following command instead:

     ```
     ftp <userID@ip.of.zos.box>
     ```

     **Note:** When you use FTP, switch to binary file transfer mode by issuing the following command:

     ```
     bin
     ```

    c. Navigate to the target directory that you wish to transfer the Zowe PAX file into on z/OS.

    **Note:** After you connect to z/OS and enter your password, you enter into the Unix file system. The following commands are useful:

    - To see what directory you are in, type `pwd`.
    - To switch directory, type `cd`.
    - To list the contents of a directory, type `ls`.
    - To create a directory, type `mkdir`.   

    d. When you are in the directory you want to transfer the Zowe PAX file into, issue the following command:

     ```
     put <pax-file-name>.pax
     ```

    Where _pax-file-name_ is a variable that indicates the full name of the PAX file you downloaded.

    **Note:** When your terminal is connected to z/OS through FTP or SFTP, you can prepend commands with `l` to have them issued against your desktop.  To list the contents of a directory on your desktop, type `lls` where `ls` will list contents of a directory on z/OS.  

2. When the PAX file is transferred, expand the PAX file by issuing the following command in an ssh session:

    ```
    pax -ppx -rf <pax-file-name>.pax
    ```  

    Where _pax-file-name_ is a variable that indicates the name of the PAX file you downloaded.


    This will expand to a file structure.

    ```
      /files
      /install
      /scripts
      ...
    ```

     **Note**: The PAX file will expand into the current directory. A good practice is to keep the installation directory apart from the directory that contains the PAX file.  To do this, you can create a directory such as `/zowe/paxes` that contains the PAX files, and another such as `/zowe/builds`.  Use SFTP to transfer the Zowe PAX file into the `/zowe/paxes` directory, use the `cd` command to switch into `/zowe/builds` and issue the command `pax -ppx -rf ../paxes/<zowe-v.r.m>.pax`.  The `/install` folder will be created inside the `zowe/builds` directory from where the installation can be launched.
