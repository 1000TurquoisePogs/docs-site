# Code categories

The Zowe codebase is split into a few key areas, with both unique and shared guidelines on how to write new code. A few such areas are:

- Server Core
- Server Security
- Microservices
- Zowe Desktop Applications
- Zowe Application Framework
- Core CLI and CLI Plug-ins
- Imperative CLI Framework

# Languages

For each area of the codebase, there are established and favored programming languages. Each repo in Github identifies the primary langue used. Some of the basic skills needed to contribute to the project include:

- **CLI** - Node.js, Typescript
- **Desktop UI** - node.js, javascript
- **APIs** - C, Assembler, Java, Spring
- **API Mediation Layer** - Java, Spring

**Note:** Javascript is not recommended and should be avoided in favor of Typescript in order to utilize typing.

# Component-specific guidelines and tutorials

This "Code Guidelines" section provides high-level best practices. Each component may have more specific contribution guidelines. Look for a CONTRIBUTING.md file in the component's GitHub repository for specific details.

For tutorials related to developing Zowe applications and plug-ins or extending Zowe with APIs, see [Extending](../e).
