# Zowe Conformance Program

## Introduction

Administered by the Open Mainframe Project, the Zowe&trade; Conformance Program aims to give users the confidence that when they use a product, app, or distribution that leverages Zowe, they can expect a high level of common functionality, interoperability, and user experience.  

Conformance provides Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), System Integrators (SIs), and end users greater confidence that their software will behave as expected. Just like Zowe, the Zowe Conformance Program will continue to evolve and is being developed by committers and contributors in the Zowe community.

As vendors, you are invited to submit conformance testing results for review and approval by the Open Mainframe Project. If your company provides software based on Zowe, you are encouraged to get certified today.

## How to participate

To participate in the Zowe Conformance Program, follow the process on the [Zowe Conformance Program website](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/zowe/conformance). You can also find a list of products that have earned Zowe Conformant status.  

To learn the criteria of achieving Zowe conformance for an offering, see [Zowe Conformance Criteria](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/tree/master/zowe_conformance).

## How to suggest updates to the Zowe conformance program

If you find a mistake with the Zowe conformance documents, or are a Zowe squad lead and wish to make an amendment to the criteria, these are held in markdown format at HTML table format at https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/blob/master/zowe_conformance/test_evaluation_guide_table.md.  This file is used to create the Zowe conformance criteria.  If you do update the table of criteria.  The same information is also held in the markdown file https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/blob/master/zowe_conformance/test_evaluation_guide.md that has history going back to Zowe 2019 conformance and allows easy change history comparision.

To submit a proposal to update the conformance critera fork the repository https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation and make a pull request.  Flag this to the attention of github user ID @mertic, and also reach out to the Zowe onboarders squad in the slack workspace openmainframeproject.slack.com channel [#zowe-onboardding](https://openmainframeproject.slack.com/archives/CC60ALD61).
