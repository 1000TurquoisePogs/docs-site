# Troubleshooting Zowe through the Support Team

To ensure that the Zowe Support Team can effectively troubleshoot Zowe, the Brightside team introduces a script that captures the diagnostics data that is required for successful troubleshooting. By running the UNIX script on your z/OS environment, you receive a set of output files, which contain all relevant diagnostics data necessary to start a troubleshooting process. You can find the script in the folder with the rest of Zowe scripts. The script captures the following data:

 - Started task output
    - Zowe server started task
    - Zowe Cross Memory started task (STC)
        - Zowe CLI or REXX (TSO output command, STATUS, capture all)
 - Configuration parameters
     - Installation log
     - Scripts that are called from `run-zowe.sh`
 - Versions:
    - manifest.json
    - z/OS version
    - Java version
    - Node version
 - Additional logs
    - Zowe app server 
    - zLUX app server
 - Process list with CPU info
 - /bin/ps-A -opid,jobname,time,args grep $ (zowe_STC-prefix)
 - Certificates diagnostics - in install.logÂ
