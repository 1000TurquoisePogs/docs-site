# Raising a CLI issue on GitHub

When necessary, you can raise Git Issues against the CLI repo located here [CLI Issues](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues). We suggest using either the bug or enhancement template.

## Raising a bug report
Please provide as much of the [Must-gather information for Zowe CLI](mustgather-cli.md) as is reasonable. It may be necessary for 
anyone working on the issue to request this and additional information if this is not supplied initially. Most important is a description 
of the error and how it can be reproduced.

## Raising an enhancement report
These are just as important to Zowe as bug reports and should represent clear and detailed details of new customer requirements.
