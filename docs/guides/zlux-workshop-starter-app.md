# Workshop starter App

This application is one of a two part tutorial on application building.
This is the starter application of the tutorial.
The application's scenario is that it has been opened to submit a task report to a set of users who can handle the task.
In this case, it is a bug report. We want to find engineers who can fix the bug, but this application does not contain a listing for engineers in the company, so we need to communicate with another application, which does provide this information.
In this tutorial, you must build an application (which is then called by this application) in order to list engineers. The list can be filtered by the engineer's office and can indicate which engineers which would be able to handle the task.

You can work through the tutorial by completing the tasks in the README of the [workshop-user-browser-app](https://github.com/gizafoundation/workshop-user-browser-app) repository.

This is a tutorial application intended to be done in a workshop session, where the you will develop through step-by-step guidance an application that communicates with a provided application to accomplish a simple application-to-application communication flow coded and visualized using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Typescript, Angular, and the Zowe application framework.
