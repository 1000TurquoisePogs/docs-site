## Version 1.1.0 (April 2019)

Version 1.1.0 contains the following changes since the last 1.0.x version.

### What's new in Zowe installation on z/OS
z/OSMF Lite is now available for non-production use such as development, proof-of-concept, demo and so on. It simplifies the setup of z/OSMF with only a minimal amount of z/OS customization, but provides key functions that are required. For more information, see [Configuring z/OSMF Lite (for non-production use)](../user-guide/systemrequirements-zosmf-lite.md).

### What's new in the Zowe App Server
- Made the following user experience improvements:
  - Enabled the Desktop to react to session expiration information from the Zowe Application Server. If a user is active the Desktop renews their session before it expires. If a user appears inactive they are prompted  and can click to renew the session. If they don't click, they are logged out with a session expired message.
  - Added the ability to programmatically dismiss popups created with the "zlux-widgets" popup manager.
- Made the following security improvements:
  - Encoded URIs shown in the App Server 404 handler, which prevents  some browsers from loading malicious scripts.
  - Documented and support configuring HTTPS on ZSS.
  - For ZSS API callers, added HTTP response headers to instruct clients not to cache HTTPS responses from potentially sensitive APIs.
- Improved the Zowe Editor App by adding app2app communication support that allows the application to open requested directories, dataset listings, and files.
- Improved the Zowe App API by allowing subscription to close events on viewports instead of windows, which allows applications to better support Single App Mode.
- Fixed a bug that generated an extraneous RACF audit message when you started ZSS.
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes move application windows when you attempted to resized them.
- Fixed a bug in the "Getting started with the ZOWE WebUi" tutorial documentation.
- Fixed a bug that caused applications that made ZSS service requests to fail with an HTTP 401 error because of dropped session cookies.
